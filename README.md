By leveraging the Governance protocol, we are offering a weekly prize game on a background of low-yield staking.

Prizes are generated on the interest earned on deposited funds through participation in the Algorand Governance program. The registration and voting process is automated for our users with votes aligning with the Algorand Foundationâ€™s recommendations.

A large portion of the ALGO rewards generated from participation in Governance is earmarked for the prize pool.

The web-based Optimum app is our interface for interacting with the smart contract deployed to the Algorand blockchain. Through this interface, users have the ability to deposit ALGO in exchange for the OPT token. Deposits are enabled after the reward distribution from the previous Governance period and prior to end of the sign-up phase for the current Governance period.

Optimum is a non-custodial protocol, which means the original user retains complete control of their funds. We recognize the importance of liquidity and have made careful design decisions to enable withdrawals at any time.
